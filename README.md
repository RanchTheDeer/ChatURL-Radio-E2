# ChatURL Radio E2

This is a repository holding the latest public release of my ChatURL Radio E2.
Expression 2 is a programming language for the game Garry's Mod. This is designed for use as an Expression 2 chip.

_*This E2 is meant for advanced users, as the setup is complicated and it is very unstable! If you don't know what you're doing, don't use it!*_
 
## Setup

To use the E2, you must first make sure that you have HTTP core enabled, and that you have installed the Streamcore extension (available on the Garry's Mod workshop).
After that, obtain an API key from here:
http://ytdl.gaerisson-softs.fr/E2/
Assign the key to the "YT2MP3APIKey" string.

Assign your SteamID provided by the website to the "SteamID" variable.

To use the search function of the E2, you must obtain a Google API key for the Youtube Search v3 API. This is not required for normal operation as you may specify Youtube IDs directly using the ytid command, however is recommended for ease of use.
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com

Make sure to change the GoogleAPIKey, YT2MP3APIKey and SteamID variables respectively.
